Realisation of Dual Momentum Trading strategy of Gary Antonacci
https://dualmomentum.net/
Basically we first check the relative momentum between US equities (SPY) and International equities (EFA), and choose the best market, then we check absolute momentum against SHY ETF (short term treauries) and if momentum is positive we invest into the chosen market (SPY/EFA) otherwise we invest to bonds (TLT).
